// What it is

BBF is a copy of the extremely excellent HTML5 Boilerplate by Paul Irish (http://html5boilerplate.com/) fitted with a helpful PHP script that allows you to create static html websites with ease.

// Usage Overview

1. Drop the files on your webserver anywhere (that has PHP and mod_rewrite)
2. Rename 'default.htaccess' to simply '.htaccess'
3. Set the values in config.php to the ones appropriate for your website
4. Modify the file header and footer in /inc/layout/header.php and /inc/layout/footer.php
5. Add your own css to /css/style.css
6. Add content pages under the /inc folder.
7. Profit!

// File Structure

The way file structure works is very simple - the goal here is to make it as quick and easy for you to add static html files.

If you want to add a contact page, for example, you would add a file called contact.php to the folder /inc. If you then link to yourdomain.com/contact, the script will automatically look first for a file called contact.php, and failing that, look for contact/default.php

This method works for up to 2 levels of depth, allow you to create categories and subcategories. Here are some examples of how this works:

domain.com/contact                ->  /inc/contact.php
domain.com/aboutus                ->  /inc/aboutus/default.php
domain.com/aboutus/staff          ->  /inc/aboutus/staff.php
domain.com/services/all           ->  /inc/services/all/default.php
domain.com/services/all/plumbing  ->  /inc/services/all/plumbing.php

Note: if your website is in a subdirectory of another domain, take that in to account with your links. i.e. if you're under domain.com/stuff/, your links should be to /stuff/links
